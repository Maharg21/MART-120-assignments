<h1> Trying to come up with something creative for an assignment</h1> 
        <p> Something that I don't understand is I'm majoring in Media arts 
    where you get to learn a variety of methods to express your creativity
    yet when it comes to an assignment (or finals in this regard) I can't 
    for the life of me come up with something original. It's funny, I'm a 
    video editor, been editing videos for a very long time since middle
    school, then started doing it professionally in high school. I help
    with production with an art show my friend and I made a few years ago,
    I even edit videos of me and my friends playing games just for fun. 
    I do what I call <span>"Improv editing"</span>, basically in both these projects,
    we don't use a script or plan anything other than the premise, we just 
    go with the flow, it's all real time with real interactions. I try
    to edit whatever we said or did in that recording. I cut down the 
    footage that's typically 45-60 minutes to a 15-20 minute long video.
    It's tedious, but extremely fun exagerating all the dialogue and
    whatever funny moments we all did.
    So when it comes to a media arts project, where you can do whatever you 
    want with the methods you've been taught, surely I can come up with something
    amazing...right?
    I really have nothing, I wish I could show what I'm capable of, and yet my 
    brain's emptier than an air pump with a leak. It kind of makes you wonder 
    how this happens anyway. Could it be that whatever's expected for the assignment
    doesn't tie well with my creative ambitions? Click on the next page to find out 
    what I think. </p>
