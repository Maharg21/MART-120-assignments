<h1>My thoughts</h1>
<p>
I think it could just be the timing and the situation of the projects.
Everyone's a bit different with their creativity. For me, it's a lot easier
finding a vision with videos than coding. Coding really cool, but I find it
a bit overwhelming. There's a lot of things you need to remember to make sure
everything's connected for it to work, if you spelled something wrong or typed 
the wrong command or setting, it won't work, then you have to backtrack and find 
out what went wrong and then you fix it, then something else doesn't work, lots of 
tediousness. But like all creative projects, when you spend a long time on it and
everything's the way you want it to work, it's the most satisfying feeling, watching
or interacting with what you make, it makes the whole thing worth it. Coding is 
definetely no exception. <br />
Sorry if this final assignment's a little lackluster and seems like a writing final
for a Gen Ed requirement, but I've been spending this week thinking about what to do 
and mixing that with the procrastination has been driving me crazy, so I went with 
the quicker easier route. I enjoyed this class and really appreciate the easy communication
and the tutorials that were always helpful. Coding is interesting, but I don't think it's 
for me and I think I'll stick with what I've been always good at. Thanks again!
