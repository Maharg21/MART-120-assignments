	<p> My name's Graham Martin, This is the second semester of my 3rd year, currently
wrapping up classes for my Music Minor. Editing videos is one of my favorite things to do. It's really tedious,
but the end result is always satisfying when I'm done, I try not to miss details in my videos and try to make them
engaging and enjoyable to watch. Not many people besides my friends watch them, but I'm totally okay with them being the only ones. 
	I'm hoping to land an internship with a local media production company in Missoula called Warm Springs Productions. So far they're 
definetely considering me to attend, but unfortunately they're at a really busy point and can't accept me right now. My hope is I can get it by March. 
	I'm also a producer for an art show called Dude I Just Drew, which is a show where my friend challenges local artists in Missoula to a drawing 
contest where they have to draw a random suggestion in 5 minutes each. We've been doing it for almost 3 years now and I've edited over 30 videos 
in that time and I'm really proud where they're at. Below are a couple images of my friend's artwork, which I find pretty amazing.
